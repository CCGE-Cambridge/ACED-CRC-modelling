## Project abstract

**Objectives:** To quantify the contributions of polygenic scores, primary care records (presenting symptoms, medical history and common blood tests) and lifestyle factors, for short-term risk prediction of colorectal cancer (CRC) in general and symptomatic individuals. 

**Methods and Analysis:** This prospective cohort study used data from the UK Biobank with follow-up until 2018. It included 160,507 participants with linked primary care records, and a subcohort of 42,782 participants with recent CRC-related symptoms. The outcome was the first-recorded CRC diagnosis within two years. Dynamic risk models with time-varying predictors were derived using a super-landmark framework. Model discrimination was assessed through Harrelâ€™s C-index, and predictor contributions to model discrimination were evaluated using inclusion-order-agnostic Shapley values.

**Results:** C-indices [95% CIs] were 0.73 [0.72-0.73] and 0.69 [0.68-0.70] for the general and symptomatic participants respectively. Shapley contributions to model discrimination [95% CIs] were: core predictors (e.g., age, sex) 33% [25%-42%] (symptomatic: 34% [9%-75%]), polygenic scores 16% [8%-26%] (8% [-21%-35%]), primary care blood tests 32% [19%-43%] (41% [16%-73%]), medical history 11% [4%-17%] (9% [-25%-37%]), lifestyle factors 6% [0%-11%] (-5% [-32%-13.4%]), and symptoms 3% [-2%-7%] (13% [-19%-41%]).  

**Conclusions:** Polygenic scores contribute substantially to short-term risk prediction for CRC in both general and symptomatic populations; however, the contribution of information in primary care records (including presenting symptoms, medical history and common blood tests) is greater. Lifestyle factors not routinely collected in primary care contribute minimally.
